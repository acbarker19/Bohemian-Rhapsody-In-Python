# Bohemian Rhapsody in Python
A Python script that creates a MIDI rendition of "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Freddie Mercury. This project only performs the ballad section of the song.

This was my midterm project for my CSC 299 class, Making Music with Computers, at the University of Mount Union that was taught by Dr. Sarah Huibregtse. Other projects from the class can be found at [this link](https://github.com/acbarker19/CSC299-Making-Music-With-Computers).

This project utilizes libraries from Jython Music found here: https://jythonmusic.me/

The files in this repository are:
- `Barker_Bohemian_Rhapsody.py`: The Python script that creates an arrangement of MIDI notes to play the song
- `bohemian_rhapsody.midi`: The MIDI song produced by the Python script
- `Queen_BohemianRhapsody.pdf`: The sheet music that was used to produce the MIDI song

To listen to the song, `bohemian_rhapsody.midi` can be played on any MIDI-capable device. To alter the notes or export the song in a different way, the `Barker_Bohemian_Rhapsody.py` file can be edited and run.
